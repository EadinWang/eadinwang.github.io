	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>此时此地 HERE&amp;NOW is a mini program design as the outcome of a research project supervised by Dr. Yanyue Yuan under <em>NYU Shanghai Deans&#x27; Undergraduate Research Fund</em>. </p><p>It aims at enhancing young audience’s museum visiting and learning experience by expanding the museum to urban spaces.</p>

	  <h3>Progress</h3><p>I teamed up with <strong>Sophie Peng</strong>. We started with literature review on museum visiting design. </p>
		<p>Materials include but are not limited to: <a href="https://www.participatorymuseum.org/read/"><u class="content-link"><em>Participatory Museum</em></u></a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JSJnKxXjt5X9miwz3anAgVTcFLMcYdgH/view?usp=sharing"><u class="content-link"><em>The Journey as Concept for Digital Museum Design</em></u></a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228826627_Beyond_mere_information_provisioning_a_handheld_museum_guide_based_on_social_activities_and_playful_learning"><u class="content-link"><em>Beyond mere information provisioning: a handheld museum guide based on social activities and playful learning</em></u></a></p><figure id="a4795ec6-918d-425f-88c5-d4b945f8b1c3" class="image"><img src="work-images/notes.png" alt=""/><figcaption>My reflection apart from regular notes</figcaption></figure><br>
		<p>I visited Suzhou Museum West and Shanghai History Museum, conducted 4 interviews (7 in total as a group), observed, recorded, and thought. </p>
		<p>We ended up basing our design on exhibits from Shanghai History Museum. <strong>We wanted to attract young generations’ learning attention and enhance resonance with such traditional museums by integrating some kind of popular culture. </strong></p><p>Furthermore, we found visitors <strong>are really interested in listening to 冷知识(trivia/stories) after exhibits, and enjoyed the sense of self-exploration while visiting. </strong></p><img style="width:2201px" src="work-images/DURF_Museum.jpg" alt=""/>

		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>We refered to the concept of “city walk”, and designed 此时此地 HERE&amp;NOW. It guides visitors to explore different sites in urban spaces and learn historical knowledge behind museum exhibits. <div class="indented"><p>Users are free to follow routes provided or search and choose themes and sites by their own. During the site exploration, users can read and listen to text and audio materials. </p><p>They then take photo/video and record thoughts and reflections as the completion of one exploration. </p><p>In addition, users can make their records public and view other audiences’ as well, contributing to a collaborative content creation and sense of community. </p></div></p><p>The UI might not be that perfect. However, our focus here was to present <strong>the flow of experience. </strong>If I have chance to continue developing on this project, I would like to polish the interface design aside from other improvements. </p><img src="work-images/Yiting Wang_Xiao Peng_Virtual Museum in the Urban Space.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption>Figma program flow</figcaption><br>
